# JSMongoDBDocker - Developing with Docker

This is a simple user profile application implemented using various Docker-based components. The app consists of an index.html file with pure JavaScript and CSS styles for the frontend, a Node.js backend powered by the Express module, and MongoDB for data storage.

To facilitate the seamless deployment and management of the application, all the components are containerized using Docker. You can access the application either using Docker with Docker Network or using the Docker Compose file.

You can also build a docker image from the application with the Dockerfile.
